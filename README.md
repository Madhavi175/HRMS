The aim of this Human Resource Management System project is to build a system that will help a company manage its human resources. The Human Resource Management System will have a project module. All records of employees will be maintained on the system along with their skills and abilities. When a new project is assigned to a team, the project module creates a new file. The details of the team members and estimated project completion time will be noted. The project supervisor will be required to update evaluations of team members on the system. These evaluations will be used by the system to make recommendations for promotions and raises. The final decision on promotions and raises will be made by an upper-level manager.

A recruitment module can be used during the hiring process. This module will have access to information about future projects and progress on current projects. Based on this information, it will predict the requirement of talent.

An employee module will be available to all employees to view their payroll and sanctioned leaves. All employees can easily verify the information and raise queries with the Human Resource Management System at any time using this system. Higher-level management will be able to access employee records and job statistics using this system.
